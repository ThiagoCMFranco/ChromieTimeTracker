A small yet usefull addon to fulfill a simple need, remember which Timewalk Campaign timeline you were playing after a long time away or even help you sichronize your timeline with your friends without having to ask Chromie.  

Swap between diferent layout modes and place it bellow your chat window, near the minimap, near your character nameplate or anywhere you like.  

Access your timeline summary using the game own inferface. This feature allows access to the original summary window of each expansion from Warlords of Draenor to The War Within that is usually hidden and replaced by new content after every major update.
